    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    <p>Pat was walking through Pike Place Market eating a giant cookie when a great idea hit him. No seriously, a clumsy
      worker accidentally threw a sockeye salmon right in his face just as he was about to take a bite of his cookie.
      One bite and hospital ride later Pat couldn't get his mind off the delicious taste of salmon and cookie so he set
      out to make it a reality. Today Pat's Salmon Cookies is a world renowned international franchise.
